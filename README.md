# Developer-Resources

The Developer Resources repository has a webpage where the user is able to access information regarding HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding, Github and Visual Studio coding platforms, and databanks of fonts and colors. 

# Function

The webpage is formatted in a list of hyperlinks which direct the user to individual PDF files and specific websites for coding information. Also, there is a button that when clicked switches the color of the main heading to red in order to demonstrate the use of HTML code as an example. In this repository, there is a HTML file for building the list and title of the webpage, a CSS file for customizing the format and style of the webpage, and a Javascript file for creating a function for the clickable button presented. 

# Accessibility

This webpage will be able to be accessed on any web broswer such as: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. It will also be available on any devices such as phone, tablet, or computer. Note that users must have an Internet connection required.

# How to Use

Click the button presented below 'Resources for New Developers' to toggle the color of the heading. Once clicked the color will remain red and cannot be changed if the button is pressed afterwards. Under the headings 'Coding Languages', 'Coding Tools', and 'Fonts and Colors' click on each resource. This will take the user to a PDF file of the resource or the website of the resource for view.
